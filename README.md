# Exam_Monitoring_System

This system can monitor and detect any unusual movement of a candidate giving an exam. This is an automated system that registers a newly signing candidate via his/her biometrics and takes the attendance and timing of entry of an already registered examinee also via his/her biometrics. 

This model is an end-to-end implementation of a ML model used to predict the person giving the exam from his/her biometrics and monitors whether some unusual activities takes place while giving the exam which leads to termination of the exam then and there.
